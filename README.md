# P1_positive-negative-zero
A simple Python program to check whether a number is positive, negative, or zero.

---

## 🔍 How It Works

1. The user is asked to enter a number.
2. The program uses conditional logic to check:
   - If the number > 0 → it prints `"Positive Number"`
   - If the number < 0 → it prints `"Negative Number"`
   - If the number == 0 → it prints `"Zero"`
